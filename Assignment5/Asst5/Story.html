        <h1>America Pageant</h1>

        <p>
          “I was seventeen. Only child, not a lot of friends. But I had a plan.
          I was going to become an actress, get a role on All My Children, meet
          my husband on set– and when that was all over, I’d host a talk show.
          Kelly Ripa did it; I could do it too. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Back then it seemed like every
          woman on television had gotten their start as beauty queen. So my
          senior year I decided to enter my school’s Homecoming Queen
          competition. It was organized like a Ms. America pageant. But this was
          a rough high school, only one other girl signed up, so I had a good
          shot. My whole family got behind me. My mom was a seamstress. We
          noticed that in most pageants we watched, the winner wore a white
          dress. So she sewed me a white dress that I picked out of Seventeen
          Magazine. First came the interview portion, and that’s when the
          trouble started. The judges asked me about the Anita Hill testimony; I
          wasn’t ready for that. I was ready for world peace. They were supposed
          to ask me about my goals, so I could say world peace. But that didn’t
          happen. </p>
          The talent portion was later that night at the homecoming
          dance. The whole school was there. I chose a Sheena Easton song; poor
          choice. Not the right crowd for that. The other girl chose ‘I Feel
          Good’ by Stephanie Mills, and she had the whole crowd singing along.
          That’s when I knew it was over. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
          But then, a miracle. The guidance
          counselor quieted everyone down, and announced the winner: it was me.
          Me! It was my Kelly Kapowski moment. Everyone was cheering, the other
          girl congratulated me. But it only lasted five seconds, because the
          guidance counselor said: ‘Wait a second, I’m sorry. Joanna is the
          runner-up.’ It was the worst moment of my life. 
          </p>

          <p>
          In fact, the only
          thing that got me through COVID was knowing that it could not
          possibly, possibly be worse than that moment. And here’s a twist for
          you. Remember that guidance counselor? Several years later I ended up
          acting alongside his son in a play at Queens College. In one scene I
          pulled a gun on him, and the director was like: ‘We need more anger.
          Think about something that makes you angry.’ I was like: ‘Well, that’s
          easy. His father ruined my senior year. And quite possibly, my entire
          life.”
